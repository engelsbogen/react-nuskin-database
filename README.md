## Description

Front-end code for a Web Application to record and manage a Nuskin Distributor's orders, allowing him/her to track sales/income.

## Build

The project is built with WebPack.
To build:

/usr/bin/npx webpack


## Run

This project runs in conjunction with a Spring Boot Java application which extracts information from the database

However, it is possible to try out the main page stand-alone using the npm server:

**serve -s build -l 4000**

This will simply show an empty "Orders" table.
